# AI Elective ‚Äì Student Deliverables (5 ECTS)

This is a placeholder for the student deliverables for the **AI Elective (5 ECTS)** at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft.

As part of the course, students developed data- and AI-driven quantitative analysis of architectural projects. In addition to their posters, each student group wrote a blog post to reflect on their process, methodology, and outcomes.
